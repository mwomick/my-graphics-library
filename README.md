# my-graphics-library

This is an efficient minimal graphics library, inspired by the [Skia Graphics Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skia_Graphics_Engine) designed as a project for [COMP 475](http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/Courses/comp475-f18/) at [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu). Currently, it supports:
- Curves (Quadratic and Cubic)
- Circles
- Shaded Triangles
- Quadrilaterals
- Quadrilateral Subdivision
- Transformations
- Rectangular Clipping
- Polygons
- SVG-like Path Stroking
- Porter-Duff Color Blending
- Gradient and Bitmap Shaders
- And more!

It is a work in progress. I expect to add new features/ enhancements as time goes on.

## Current Projects
- Bitmap Caching for Shaders
- Radial Gradient Shader
- Improved (and correct!) Clipping
